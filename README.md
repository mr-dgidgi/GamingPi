# GamingPi

## Work In Progress

RaspberryPi with web interface to launch Retropie, Steamlink and Kodi.

The script should be working actually but not tested actually

The GamingPi use xserver-xorg-input-joystick package to allow navigation on the launcher with the gamepad

- Use OSOL tu launch game from other launchers than steam and make them available in steamlink : https://github.com/WombatFromHell/OriginSteamOverlayLauncher/wiki

- Support of HDMI CEC partially working. Actually the GamingPi can start the TV but I wasn't table to set more thing as a lot of HDMI CEC fonctionality are not impremented (Thomson TV)

### Fonctionality to add

- mouse controlled by TV controller via HDMI CEC
- stop/reboot button on the launcher WIP
- add spash screen (create a logo ?)
